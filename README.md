# Slide Show Generator
This generator was developed mainly for Forumotion forums, but can be applied elsewhere as well. The generator works completely without jQuery, but the slide show makes use of the jQuery animate() method. If the library is not present, then the slide show will not rotate.

You can install this generator on your Forumotion forum via the following path. Administration Panel > Modules > HTML Pages management > Create a new HTML page in advanced mode. Make sure that you tick "Yes" to use your forum's header and footer. When finished save and you should now have the generator on your forum.
